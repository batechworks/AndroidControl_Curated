## üåü Overview

On-device virtual assistants like Siri and Google Assistant are increasingly pivotal, yet their capabilities are hamstrung by a reliance on rigid, developer-dependent APIs. GUI agents offer a powerful, API-independent alternative, but their adoption is hindered by the perception of poor performance, as ~3B parameter models score as low as 60% on benchmarks like AndroidControl, far from viability for real-world use.

Our research reveals that issue lies not only with the models but with the benchmarks themselves. We identified notable shortcomings in AndroidControl, including ambiguities and factual errors, which systematically underrates agent capabilities. To address this critical oversight, we enhanced AndroidControl into **AndroidControl-Curated**, a refined version of the benchmark improved through a rigorous purification pipeline. 

On this enhanced benchmark, state-of-the-art models achieve success rates nearing 80% on complex tasks, reflecting that on-device GUI agents are actually closer to practical deployment than previously thought. We also trained our new SOTA model, **Magma-R1**, on just 2,400 curated samples, which matches the performance of previous models trained on over 31,000 samples.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

Our methodology consists of two main parts:

### Systematic Benchmark Purification: The AndroidControl-Curated Pipeline

1. **Stage 1: From Coordinate Matching to Intent Alignment in Grounding Evaluation**
   - Replace overly strict point-based matching with bounding-box-based intent alignment
   - Evaluate whether predicted points fall within target UI element bounding boxes

2. **Stage 2: Task-Level Correction via LLM-Human Collaboration**
   - High-risk sample identification via execution consensus failure
   - Automated causal attribution and correction with LLMs
   - Rigorous human expert verification

### Training Paradigm of Magma-R1: Optimization via GRPO

- **Dense Rewards**: Gaussian kernel-based grounding reward for continuous feedback
- **Balanced Learning**: Action type proportional optimization to address class imbalance
- **Efficient Training**: Generative REINFORCE with Policy Optimization (GRPO)
